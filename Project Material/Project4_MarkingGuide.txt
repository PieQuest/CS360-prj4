Project 4 Marking Guide

Assignment must be done individually or in pairs.
(no difference in marking)

Total =  [100] marks.



[40] Array Statistics Sys-Call
    - Correctly fills the *stats struct.
    - Correctly returns 0 when successful
    - Correctly returns -EINVAL and -EFAULT appropriately.
    - Does not use a huge amount of kernel memory.
    - Extensive testing may be done by automated tests.

[50] Process Ancestors Sys-call
    - Correctly fill array of structures with process information.
    - Correctly calculate number of children and siblings.
    - Correctly returns 0 when successful
    - Correctly returns -EINVAL and -EFAULT appropriately.
    - Does not use a huge amount of kernel memory.
    - Extensive testing may be done by automated tests.

[5] Ancestors User-Mode Testing
    - Correctly builds via Makefile, transfers to QEMU via "transfer" target.
    - Reasonable test program to exercise the syscall.
    - Must at least test some error conditions (bad pointers, ...)

[5] Good code quality
    - Kernel patch must correctly apply otherwise significant mark penalty is possible (>5 penalty)
    - Near perfect indentation and great code structure.
    - Code which does not compile will receive 0 marks total.
    - Reasonable names for variables and functions.


Forward to Dr. Rrushi if:
- Material is suspiciously similar to another submission or code posted online.

Marking Note: 
- Updates to the syscall_64.tbl file trigger full kernel rebuild.
  Copy out "golden" copy, and copy back in with: "cp -p ..." to preserve the timestamp.
